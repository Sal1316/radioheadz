# <Radioheadz>

## Description

- We embarked on this project to address a gap in related apps. In this application, users can search for stations by city. Once the desired city is found, users have the option to select stations that might not be available in other applications. Constructing this application presented challenges, particularly in setting up the backend. As new developers, we sought guidance when faced with coding obstacles. Despite this challenge, we learned how to collaborate more effectively as a team. We adopted a team style that leveraged each member's strengths.

## Installation
